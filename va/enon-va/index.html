            <p>In 1611, 300 musketeers were ordered by the Virginia Company of London to travel away from the unsafe swamplands of Jamestown and develop a new capital of Virginia, and were led by Sir Thomas Dale. This colony had become the second successful British colony in Virginia. It has been largely undeveloped until the development of the River's Bend Golf Course and residential development including River’s Bend, starting in 1988.</p>
