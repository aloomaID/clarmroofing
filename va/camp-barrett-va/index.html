            <p>The Officer Basic Course currently lasts 28 weeks, during which new officers receive classroom, field, and practical application training on weapons, tactics, leadership and protocol. The course is split into three graded categories:, Leadership, Academics, and Military Skills. Much like OCS, graded events are split between events that are graded and events that must be passed. Events that must be passed are the 15-mile hike, all three exams, the Endurance Course, Final Land Navigation, Night Land Navigation, and Rifle and Pistol Qualification. Events that simply earn a grade are the 3, 6, 9, and 12 mile hikes, leadership billets in field exercises, and various decision-making exercises.</p>
