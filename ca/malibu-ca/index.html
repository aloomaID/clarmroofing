            <h3>Malibu, CA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Malibu (/ˈmælɪbuː/ MAL-ih-boo, is a beach city in the Santa Monica Mountains region of Los Angeles County, California, about 30 miles (48 km) west of Downtown Los Angeles. It is known for its Mediterranean climate, its strip of beaches stretching 21 miles (34 km) along the Pacific Ocean coast, and for its longtime status as the home of numerous affluent Hollywood celebrities and executives. Although a high proportion of its residents are entertainment industry figures with million-dollar mansions, Malibu also features several middle- and upper-middle-class neighborhoods. The Pacific Coast Highway (State Route 1) traverses the city and has led most residents to settle anywhere from half a mile (0.8 km) to within a few hundred yards of it, with some residents living up to one mile (1.6 km) away from the beach in areas featuring narrow canyons. As of the 2020 census, the city's population was 10,654.</p>
