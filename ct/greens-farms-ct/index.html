                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>The boundaries of the neighborhood, like those of most neighborhoods with no governmental status, are vague, but according to a New York Times article in 2001, 'generally, a resident can confidently claim a Green's Farms address if the property lies within the area bounded by Hillspoint Road, the Fairfield town line and the Post Road'. The Greens Farms census-designated place as drawn in 2020 follows the same boundaries. According to the same article, Turkey Hill Road and Morningside Drive are the heart of the neighborhood.</p>
