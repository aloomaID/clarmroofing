                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>A few years later, George Rote (Rhoade) laid out a village just east of Youngmanstown, known as Greenville or Rotestown, after his death. Eventually, the two settlements merged at Third Street. In 1827, the two villages combined and were incorporated, the combined village was named Mifflinburg, in honor of Thomas Mifflin, the first Governor of Pennsylvania after the 1790 Constitution. Historically the town was known for the manufacture of horse-drawn vehicles, known as buggies.</p>
