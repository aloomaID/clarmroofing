            <h3>Southwest Greensburg, PA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>In 1769, John Peter Miller was granted provisional ownership of land within the current-day boundaries of Southwest Greensburg, and he received full ownership rights in 1789. Miller was told that the first settler traditionally has the right to name a community, and when Miller was asked what name he preferred for the area, he responded with 'What you please?'  As a result, the community - at that point a mere collection of farms - bore the unusual name 'What You Please?' for many decades, in what was undoubtedly an expression of settlers' sense of humor.</p>
